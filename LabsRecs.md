# Project : Automatic Documentation Generation

Welcome to the IRIS Labs Recruitment Task! This year at IRIS Labs, we are focussing on **Automating Code Documentation**, with the help of LLMs and other NLP methodologies!

## Motivation 

Maintaining up-to-date and accurate documentation is important for the success and sustainability of projects. However, the manual creation and upkeep of documentation are often time-consuming and prone to errors. This project proposes the development and implementation of an automated documentation generation system, to streamline and enhance the documentation process, ensuring consistency, accuracy, and efficiency.
